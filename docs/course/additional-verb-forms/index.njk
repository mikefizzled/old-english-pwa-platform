    <h2>Additional Verb Forms</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">B</span>efore we move on to looking at strong
      verbs, there are some additional features of Old English verbs that it is worth knowing about,
      namely, <strong>modal auxiliaries</strong>, the <strong>inflected infinitive</strong>,
      <strong>participles</strong>, and the use of <strong>prefixes</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>Modal Auxiliaries</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>modal auxiliary</strong> is a verb that is used with another verb to express a mood
      or tense. As in modern English, Old English makes frequent use of modal verbs such as 'can',
      'should', and 'must'. When these modal verbs are used in Old English, the verb that follows
      often goes to the end of the sentence.
    </p>
    <h3>Inflected Infinitive</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>inflected infinitive</strong> is often used in clauses expressing a purpose, and
      can often be translated as 'in order to' + the verb in question. This form always follows the
      preposition 'to' and usually ends with <strong>-enne</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>Participles</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Participles</strong> are verb forms which function as adjectives, but they are also
      often used in the formation of tenses in modern English. Modern English has a present
      participle, ending in <strong>-ing</strong> and a past participle ending in
      <strong>-ed</strong> for weak verbs. We can use the present participle of a verb like 'to
      talk' both to form tenses like the past continuous '<em>I was talking</em>' and as an
      adjective, '<em>The talking dog</em>'. We will see that participles in Old English can be used
      in much the same way.
    </p>
    <h3>Prefixes</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, Old English makes extensive use of <strong>prefixes</strong> which change the meaning
      of the verb they are attached to. In addition to modern English 'lock' <em>lucan</em> and
      'unlock' <em>onlucan</em>, Old English had '<em>belucan - to lock up</em>'; '<em
        >tolucan - to pull or twist apart</em
      >' and '<em>gelucan - to lock, but with purpose</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will cover these handy prefixes at the end of this lesson, but first we will look at
      <strong>modal auxiliaries</strong>. If you need a recap of verbs before continuing, you can
