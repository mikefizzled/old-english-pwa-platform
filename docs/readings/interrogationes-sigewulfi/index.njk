      The '<em>Interrogationes Sigwylfi Presbiteri</em>', also known as ‘Questions about Genesis’,
      was originally a late-8th century Latin commentary on the Book of Genesis by the English
      scholar Alcuin of York, in which he addresses the questions of a priest named Sigewulf.

    <p>
      Though he studied under Archbishop Ecgbert at York, Alcuin became a teacher at the Carolingian
      court at the invitation of King Charlemagne, and it was there he wrote the commentaries. It
      was translated into Old English by Ælfric of Eynshamin the 10th Century.

      <strong>Cotton MS Julius E VII</strong> and is the full introduction to the
      '<em>Interrogationes</em>'.
